    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

    <p>
        Thank you for using Ecstatic ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about how we handle information when you use our mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Our application is designed to function without collecting any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not track your activity in a way that can be linked back to you personally.
        <br><br>
        The only data stored is on your local device (e.g., bookmarks), which you have full control over.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use it for any purpose. The app's functionality is self-contained on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        We do not have any personal information to share or sell. We will not disclose any user data to third parties because we do not collect it in the first place.
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our app may contain advertisements served by third-party ad networks. These networks may use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect non-personal information about your device and usage to serve relevant ads. We do not have access to or control over these third-party technologies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our application is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
